# moveit

This app was built during the NWL - Next Level Week #4, event organized by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br).  

It is an enhanced [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) app that helps the user not only to keep concentrated and productive but also to move himself during the pauses.  

At each pause the user receives a new challenge. Completing the challenges, the user earn points and can level up. 
The intervals use to be 25 minutes but for now it is set to 1 minute.
